KITCHEN
#1 There are a number of ways to save water, and they all start with you.
#2 When washing dishes by hand, don’t let the water run. Fill one basin with wash water and the other with rinse water.
#3 Dishwashers typically use less water than washing dishes by hand. Now, Energy Star dishwashers save even more water and energy.
#4 If your dishwasher is new, cut back on rinsing. Newer models clean more thoroughly than older ones.
#5 Designate one glass for your drinking water each day, or refill a water bottle. This will cut down on the number of glasses to wash.
#6 Soak pots and pans instead of letting the water run while you scrape them clean.
#7 Use the garbage disposal sparingly. Instead, compost vegetable food waste and save gallons every time.
#8 Wash your fruits and vegetables in a pan of water instead of running water from the tap.
#9 Don’t use running water to thaw food. For water efficiency and food safety, defrost food in the refrigerator.
#10 Install an instant water heater near your kitchen sink so you don’t have to run the water while it heats up. This also reduces energy costs.
#11 Keep a pitcher of drinking water in the refrigerator instead of running the tap. This way, every drop goes down you and not the drain.
#12 Reuse leftover water from cooked or steamed foods to start a nutritious soup, it’s one more way to get eight glasses of water a day.
#13 Cook food in as little water as possible. This also helps it retain more nutrients.
#14 Select the proper pan size for cooking. Large pans may require more cooking water than necessary.
#15 If you accidentally drop ice cubes, don’t throw them in the sink. Drop them in a house plant instead.
#16 Collect the water you use while rinsing fruit and vegetables. Use it to water house plants.
#17 When shopping for a new dishwasher, use the Consortium for Energy Efficiency website to compare water use between models.
LAUNDRY ROOM
#18 When doing laundry, match the water level to the size of the load.
#19 Washing dark clothes in cold water saves water and energy, and helps your clothes retain their color.
#20 When shopping for a new washing machine, compare resource savings among Energy Star models. Some can save up to 20 gallons of water per load.
#21 Have a plumber re-route your greywater to trees and plants rather than the sewer line. Check with your city and county for codes.
#22 When buying a washer, check the Consortium for Energy Efficiency website to compare water use between models.
BATHROOM
#23 If your shower fills a one-gallon bucket in less than 20 seconds, replace the showerhead with a WaterSense® labeled model.
#24 Shorten your shower by a minute or two and you’ll save up to 150 gallons per month.
#25 Time your shower to keep it under 5 minutes. You’ll save up to 1,000 gallons per month.
#26 Toilet leaks can be silent! Be sure to test your toilet for leaks at least once a year.
#27 Put food coloring in your toilet tank. If it seeps into the bowl without flushing, there’s a leak. Fix it and start saving gallons.
#28 When running a bath, plug the bathtub before turning on the water. Adjust the temperature as the tub fills.
#29 Upgrade older toilets with water-saving WaterSense® labeled models.
#30 If your toilet flapper doesn’t close properly after flushing, replace it.
#31 Use a WaterSense® labeled showerhead. They’re inexpensive, easy to install, and can save you up to 750 gallons a month.
#32 Turn off the water while you brush your teeth and save up to 4 gallons a minute. That’s up to 200 gallons a week for a family of four.
#33 If your toilet was installed before 1992, purchasing a WaterSense® labeled toilet can reduce the amount of water used for each flush.
#34 Consider buying a dual-flush toilet. It has two flush options: a half-flush for liquid waste and a full-flush for solid waste.
#35 Plug the sink instead of running the water to rinse your razor and save up to 300 gallons a month.
#36 Turn off the water while washing your hair and save up to 150 gallons a month.
#37 When washing your hands, turn the water off while you lather.
#38 Take 5-minute showers instead of baths. A full bathtub requires up to 70 gallons of water.
#39 Install water-saving aerators on all of your faucets.
#40 Drop tissues in the trash instead of flushing them and save water every time.
#41 Look for WaterSense® labeled toilets, sink faucets, urinals and showerheads.
#42 One drip every second adds up to five gallons per day! Check your faucets and showerheads for leaks.
#43 While you wait for hot water, collect the running water and use it to water plants.
