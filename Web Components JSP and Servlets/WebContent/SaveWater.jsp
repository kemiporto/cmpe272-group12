 						#1 There are a number of ways to save water, and they all start
						with you.<br /> #2 When washing dishes by hand, do not let the
						water run. Fill one basin with wash water and the other with rinse
						water.<br /> #3 Dishwashers typically use less water than washing
						dishes by hand. Now, Energy Star dishwashers save even more water
						and energy.<br /> #4 If your dishwasher is new, cut back on
						rinsing. Newer models clean more thoroughly than older ones.<br />
						#5 Designate one glass for your drinking water each day, or refill
						a water bottle. This will cut down on the number of glasses to
						wash.<br /> #6 Soak pots and pans instead of letting the water
						run while you scrape them clean.<br /> #7 Use the garbage
						disposal sparingly. Instead, compost vegetable food waste and save
						gallons every time.<br /> #8 Wash your fruits and vegetables in a
						pan of water instead of running water from the tap.<br /> #9
						Do not use running water to thaw food. For water efficiency and
						food safety, defrost food in the refrigerator.<br /> #10 Install
						an instant water heater near your kitchen sink so you don't have
						to run the water while it heats up. This also reduces energy
						costs.<br /> #11 Keep a pitcher of drinking water in the
						refrigerator instead of running the tap. This way, every drop goes
						down you and not the drain.<br /> #12 Reuse leftover water from
						cooked or steamed foods to start a nutritious soup, it's one more
						way to get eight glasses of water a day.<br /> #13 Cook food in
						as little water as possible. This also helps it retain more
						nutrients.<br /> #14 Select the proper pan size for cooking.
						Large pans may require more cooking water than necessary.<br />
						#15 If you accidentally drop ice cubes, don't throw them in the
						sink. Drop them in a house plant instead.<br /> #16 Collect the
						water you use while rinsing fruit and vegetables. Use it to water
						house plants.<br /> #17 When shopping for a new dishwasher, use
						the Consortium for Energy Efficiency website to compare water use
						between models.<br />

						shopping for a new washing machine, compare resource savings among
						Energy Star models. Some can save up to 20 gallons of water per
						load.<br /> #4 Have a plumber re-route your greywater to trees
						and plants rather than the sewer line. Check with your city and
						county for codes.<br /> #5 When buying a washer, check the
						Consortium for Energy Efficiency website to compare water use
						between models.<br />

						Toilet leaks can be silent! Be sure to test your toilet for leaks
						at least once a year.<br /> #5 Put food coloring in your toilet
						tank. If it seeps into the bowl without flushing, there's a leak.
						Fix it and start saving gallons.<br /> #6 When running a bath,

						#1 Use porous material for walkways and patios to prevent wasteful
						runoff and keep water in your yard.<br /> #2 Group plants with
						the same watering needs together to avoid overwatering some while
						underwatering others.<br /> #3 Choose the right Arizona-friendly
						plants and watch them thrive in our desert environment.<br /> #4
						Reduce the amount of lawn in your yard by planting shrubs and
						ground covers appropriate to your site and region.<br /> #5 Plant
						species native to your region.<br /> #6 Plant in the spring and
						fall, when the watering requirements are lower.<br /> #7 When
						sprucing up your front or backyard, consider xeriscaping. This
						landscape method uses low-water-use plants to limit your water
						use.<br /> #8 Consider attending a landscape class hosted by a
						water provider. Most workshops occur in the spring and fall.<br />
						#9 Avoid planting grass in areas that are hard to water, such as
						steep inclines and isolated strips along sidewalks and driveways.<br />
						#10 Leave lower branches on trees and shrubs and allow leaf litter
						to accumulate on the soil. This keeps the soil cooler and reduces
						evaporation.<br /> #11 Start a compost pile. Using compost in
						your garden or flower beds adds water-holding organic matter to
						the soil.<br /> #12 Use a layer of organic mulch on the surface
						of your planting beds to minimize weed growth that competes for
						water.<br /> #13 Spreading a layer of organic mulch around plants
						helps them retain moisture, saving water, time and money.<br />
						#14 Use 2 to 4 inches of organic mulch around plants to reduce
						evaporation and save hundreds of gallons of water a year.<br />
						#15 Visit your local xeriscape garden to view plants that thrive
						in our hot desert environment.<br /> #16 Next time you add or
						replace a flower or shrub, choose a low-water-use plant and save
						up to 550 gallons each year.<br /> #17 Call your local
						conservation office for more information about xeriscaping with
						water-thrifty trees, plants, and ground covers.<br /> #18 Collect
						water from your roof by installing gutters and downspouts. Direct
						the runoff to plants and trees.<br /> #19 For automatic water
						savings, direct water from rain gutters and HVAC systems to
						water-loving plants in your landscape.<br />

						#1 Hire a qualified pro to install your irrigation system and keep
						it working properly and efficiently.<br /> #2 Hire a Smartscape
						Certified professional landscaper who has received landscape
						training specific to the Sonoran Desert.<br /> #3 Adjust your
						lawn mower to the height of 1.5 to 2 inches. Taller grass shades
						roots and holds soil moisture better than short grass.<br /> #4
						Leave lawn clippings on your grass, this cools the ground and
						holds in moisture.<br /> #5 If installing a lawn, select a lawn
						mix or blend that matches your climate and site conditions.<br />
						#6 Aerate your lawn periodically. Holes every six inches will
						allow water to reach the roots, rather than run off the surface.<br />
						#7 If walking across the lawn leaves footprints (blades don't
						spring back up), then it is time to water.<br /> #8 Let your lawn
						go dormant (brown) during the winter. Dormant grass only needs to
						be watered every three to four weeks, less if it rains.<br /> #9
						Avoid overseeding your lawn with winter grass. Ryegrass needs
						water every few days, whereas Dormant Bermuda grass needs water
						monthly.<br /> #10 Remember to weed your lawn and garden
						regularly. Weeds compete with other plants for nutrients, light
						and water.<br /> #11 While fertilizers promote plant growth, they
						also increase water consumption. Apply the minimum amount of
						fertilizer needed.<br /> #12 Water your summer lawns once every
						three days and your winter lawn once every five days.<br /> #13
						Catch water in an empty tuna can to measure sprinkler output. 3/4
						to 1 inch of water is enough to apply each time you irrigate.<br />

 						#1 Read the Landscape Watering by the Numbers guidebook to help
						you determine how long and how much to water.<br /> #2 Use a
						trowel, shovel, or soil probe to examine soil moisture depth. If
						the top two to three inches of soil are dry, it's time to water.<br />
						#3 Set a kitchen timer when using the hose as a reminder to turn
						it off. A running hose can discharge up to 10 gallons per minute.<br />
						#4 Check your sprinkler system frequently and adjust sprinklers so
						only your lawn is watered and not the house, sidewalk or street.<br />
						#5 Minimize evaporation by watering during the early morning hours
						when temperatures are cooler and winds are lighter.<br /> #6
						Timing is everything when it comes to irrigation. Learn how to set
						your controller properly.<br /> #7 Look for WaterSense® labeled
						irrigation controllers.<br /> #8 Learn how to shut off your
						automatic watering system in case of malfunctions or rain.<br />
						#9 Apply water only as fast as the soil can absorb it.<br /> #10
						If water runs off your lawn easily, split your watering time into
						shorter periods to allow for better absorption.<br /> #11 Water
						only when necessary. More plants die from over-watering than from
						under-watering.<br /> #12 Signs of overwatering: Leaves turn
						lighter shades of green or yellow, young shoots wilt, and
						sometimes algae or fungi grow.<br /> #13 Adjust your watering
						schedule each month to match seasonal weather conditions and
						landscape requirements.<br /> #14 Install a rain sensor on your
						irrigation controller so your system won't run when it's raining.<br />
						#15 Water dry spot by hand instead of running the whole irrigation
						system longer.<br /> #16 Don't water your lawn on windy days when
						most of the water blows away or evaporates.<br /> #17 Use drip
						irrigation for shrubs and trees to apply water directly to the
						roots, where it's needed.<br /> #18 Water your plants deeply but
						less frequently to encourage deep root growth and drought
						tolerance.<br /> #19 Use sprinklers that deliver big drops of
						water close to the ground. Smaller drops and mist often evaporate
						before hitting the ground.<br /> #20 Use a rain barrel to harvest
						rainwater from gutters for watering gardens and landscapes.<br />
						#21 For hanging baskets, planters and pots, put ice cubes on top
						of the soil to give your plants a cool drink of water without
						overflow.<br /> #22 Remember to periodically check your sprinkler
						system valves for leaks, and to keep sprinkler heads in good
						shape.<br /> #23 Spring is a great time to give your irrigation
						system a checkup to ensure it's working efficiently.<br /> #24
						Pruning properly can help your plants use water more efficiently.<br />
